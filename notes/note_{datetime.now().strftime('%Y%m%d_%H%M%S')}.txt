 You know, one of the scariest things when it comes to having a conversation is engaging into a small talk. A lot of people are afraid of that, they try to avoid it, but we have to learn how to do it because it's one of the most important parts of social etiquette. So, the tip number one that I would tell you when it comes to small talk is making sure that you give general specific answers. What I mean by that is, instead of saying, you know, the weather is so hot today outside, you could say, I live in Dubai and the weather is super hot there. That gives a clue to your person who you are having a conversation with, to then continue on with questions about Dubai, how do you like living there, so on and so forth.
